## Knitting

A bot that help you to add user to a thread, to keep the thread always visible for everyone, and without pinging them!  

> **Note**  
> The user added to the thread needs to have the permission to see it.  

The bot will automatically add user to a thread when: 
- A user join the server and have the permission to see the thread
- A user is updated and get a new role
- When a channel or category have their permission edited
- When a thread is created
- When the bot join the server. Note that it needs the permissions to see the thread to add members.

The bot will also remove user that lost the perm to see the thread. Normally, discord will remove the user from the thread, but it's not always the case.  

For some optimization purpose, the bot will first @role when a thread is created (or when it joins a server). After, it will check if some user (that don't have role/allowed role) can see the thread and add them.
Moreover, if there are no role in the server, the bot process on the members instead.

> It will avoid to iterate and mention all members of the server. 
> (Imagine that the bot send 100 messages because they are 100 members in the server, it will be a lot of spam)

> **Note**  **How adding work ?**  
> The bot will send a message containing "//", edit it (so no mention because of editing message) and then delete it.   
> As the user was mentioned, the thread will be visible for them.  

### Permission asked

The bot needs some intents to work:
- Presence
- Server members

(For some reason, the bot need the presence intents to get the user id when they join the server)
