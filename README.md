## Knitting

A bot that helps you to add user to a thread, to keep the thread always visible for everyone, and without pinging them!  

> **Note**  
> The user added to the thread needs to have the permission to see it.  

The bot will automatically add a user to a thread when: 
- A user joins the server and has the permission to see the thread
- A user is updated and gets a new role
- When a channel or category that have their permission edited
- When a thread is created

The bot won't do anything when joining the server. If you want to update all threads, you can use the slash command `/update-all-threads` (see below).

### Slash Commands

If you want to manually update a thread, you can use the slash commands: 
- `/update-specific-thread [thread]` : Update a specific thread
- `/update-all-threads` : Update all threads in the server
- `/update-thread` : Update the thread where the command is used

These commands don't appear for user that doesn't have the `manage thread` permission.

> **Warning**  
> It will re-add all users that leave the thread, even if they left it on purpose.

> **Note**
> There is no way that I can code something that don't add any notification (aka white border) on the thread.
> You **always** will have the thread that becomes white when the bot activates. 

More over, you can configure the bot and disable event that you don't want to use. You can do that with the `/config` command. You can see the configuration with `/config show`

#### Configuration 

The slash command `/config` allows you to configure the bot. You can: 
- Change the language (English or French)
- Disable/Enable all events (new members, members update permission, new thread created or channel/category permission update).

If you disable everything, you set the bot in "manual" mode. You will need to use the different slash commands to update threads.

### How it's work

The bot will send a message containing "//", edit it with the list of users/roles that can see the thread, and then delete the message. As the user was mentioned, the thread will be visible for them, and only **one** message will be sent.

For some optimization purpose, the bot will first @role when a thread must be updated. After it will check if some users (that don't have role/allowed role) can see the thread and add them.
Moreover, if there is no role in the server, the bot process on the members list instead.

Note that role will be mentioned if some users that have the role aren't in the thread. 

### Permission asked

The bot needs some intents to work:
- Presence
- Server members

(For some reason, the bot needs the presence intents to get the user id when they join the server)

## ðŸ¤– Development 

The bot is made with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). You need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.
After cloning the repo, you need to install the dependencies with:
```bash
npm run init
```

> **Warning**  
> You need to use the LTS version of node (v18), not the current (v20).

The script will ask you for the bot token. You can get it on the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

By the way, the `.env` file must looks like that:
```
BOT_TOKEN=your_token
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
NODE_ENV=development # or production
```

The last part is for logging. In production, nothing (unless error) is recorded. In development, the bot will log everything in the console.

The bot uses Enmap to store data. You can find the documentation [here](https://enmap.evie.dev/). You need a special installation for it, so follow the instructions [here](https://enmap.evie.dev/install).
