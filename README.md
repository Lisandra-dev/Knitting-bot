## Thread Member Auto-Adder

A bot that help you to add user to a thread, to keep the thread always visible for everyone!

> **Note**  
> The user added to the thread need to have the permission to see it.

> **Warning**  
> For the moment, it's not possible to do not mention the user when adding them to the thread.

The bot will automatically add user to a thread when: 
- A user join the server and have the permission to see the thread
- A user is updated and get a new role
- When a channel or category have their permission edited
- When a thread is created

The bot will also remove user that lost the perm to see the thread. Normally, discord will remove the user from the thread, but it's not always the case.
